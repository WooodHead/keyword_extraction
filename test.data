It is developped in C and available under the BSD license.It splits a list of directories and file trees into a certain number ofpartitions, trying to produce partitions with the same size and number of files.It can also produce partitions with a given number of files or a limited size.Once generated, partitions are either printed as file lists to stdout (default)or to files. Those lists can then be used by third party programs.Fpart also includes a live mode, which allows it to crawl very large filesystemsand produce partitions in live. Hooks are available to act on those partitions(e.g. immediatly start a transfer using rsync(1)) without having to wait forthe filesystem traversal job to be finished. Used this way, fpart can be seenas a powerful data migration tool.

979#$#This is a task scheduler which has no  built-in  functionality, it is more of a platform to code your own tasks.It is designed on the structure of  When-If-Do  which I have translated into Triggers, Conditions and Actions. So when building tasks, you first create  definitions  of the triggers, conditions and actions. This program gives you the ability to code up a form for each definition, which would pass parameters to the trigger, condition or action itself, allowing the user to define their own parameters on task creation. After the definitions have been coded up, there is no longer a need of any coding knowledge allowing regular users to make use of this program. You can simply create a task where you would mix and match the definitions so the task behaves the way you intended.The definitions/tasks can separately be exported/imported between clients, allowing the more ��knowledgeable�� users to create libraries of definitions or tasks.

2315#$#Panini is a capsule-oriented programming language whose goals are to ease development of correct, scalable, and portable software for multicore and manycore, platforms.  Capsule-oriented programming is designed to address the challenges of concurrent programming. A central goal of this programming style is to provide tools to enable programmers to simply do what they do best, that is, to describe a system in terms of its modular structure and write sequential code to implement the operations of those modules. Capsule-oriented programs are implicitly concurrent. There are no explicit threads or synchronization locks; if necessary or beneficial, concurrency is introduced by the compiler. Capsule-oriented programming eliminates two classes of concurrency errors: sequential inconsistency and race conditions due to shared data. More details @ http://paninij.org.

2686#$#A node is a Godel like statement that the Dot Product between 2 specific nodes is a certain number. NAND is Turing Complete because all digital technology can be described as combinations of NANDs. A node that represents the statement that 2 nodes are perpendicular is a NAND because other nodes can be parallel to one, the other, but not both. This is a new branch of math that most naturally represents the Max Clique view of the P vs NP math problem (and its million dollar millenium prize for proving P equals or does not equal NP) this way: Node pairs without edges have a dot products of 0, and with edges its 1. A dot product of -1 means parallel and opposite directions. By using spring-like forces (in specific softwares using FuzzyNAND) the Max Clique math problem can be represented in a possibly hill climbable way. This is a minimalist language where statements can refer to eachother in terms of dot product. Its similar to Fast Fourier Transform as a Base Pi math system.

E.g. by usage of server side commit hooks to check for minimum acceptance levels on code and documentation quality including commit message structure and content.TortoiseSVN offers only a free form text field to edit inside the Commit Dialog. Developers might recall situations when struggling with commit message structure and fighting the server side commit hooks instead of focusing on message content! Thus being annoyed instead of feeling an incentive to deliver high quality descriptions here.The SVNStartCommitHelper is a client side start commit hook script (as a first version written in Python / Tkinter) exactly offering a well-structured form to fill in.

It is widely used in Natural Language Process (NLP) tasks, for example: word breaker, postagging, named entity recognized, query chunking and so on.CRF s mainly algorithm is the same as CRF++ written by Taku Kudo. It encodes model parameters by L-BFGS.  Moreover, it has many significant improvement than CRF++, such as totally parallel encoding, optimizing memory usage and so on. Currently, when training corpus, compared with CRF++, CRF can make full use of multi-core CPUs and only uses very low memory, and memory grow is very smoothly and slowly while amount of training corpus, tags increase. with multi-threads process, CRF is more suitable for large data and tags training than CRF++ now. For example, in machine with 64GB, CRF encodes model with more than 4.5 hundred million features quickly.
